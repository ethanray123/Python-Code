Files in this package include:
1. A modified python file that has everything (i don't know if you guys changed anything)
 * if any of you guys changed the original backend past yesterday's midnight, then copy whatever but know that i transferred the ui to the bottom of the code for ease-of-access
2. 4 variants of the background
 * about that: rename any ONE of them to "background.png" no caps or spaces exactly that kake
3. A button sprite called "button.png"
